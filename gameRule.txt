====== GAME RULE ======
Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.
You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action.
For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it.
You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).
If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match,
they must draw a card from the Draw pile.
If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card, and the game moves on to the next person in turn.
You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.
